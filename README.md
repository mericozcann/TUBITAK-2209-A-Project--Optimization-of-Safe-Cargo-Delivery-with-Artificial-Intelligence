## Abstract

This repository presents a **TÜBİTAK 2209-A–level, end-to-end artificial intelligence–based decision support system** developed to **predict, optimize, and manage operational risks** in secure cargo delivery, last-mile logistics, and product return processes.

The project focuses on replacing **reactive operational approaches** with a **proactive, risk-aware decision framework** by integrating machine learning–based risk prediction, probability optimization, and interpretable model outputs.  
The resulting system is **academically rigorous**, **methodologically sound**, and **directly applicable to real-world operational environments**.

The entire lifecycle of the project—from data preparation to model validation and final presentation—was executed in compliance with **Agile project management principles** and **academic research ethics**.

## 1. Project Objectives and Scope

The primary objective of this project is to develop a **web-oriented, AI-driven decision support infrastructure** capable of:

- Predicting **product return risk** at the individual order level  
- Supporting **secure cargo and logistics optimization decisions**  
- Producing **interpretable and actionable risk outputs**  
- Enabling **process-level proactive risk management**  
- Maintaining **academic validity and reproducibility**

The system is designed to assist operational stakeholders **before shipment decisions are finalized**, thereby reducing cost, inefficiency, and uncertainty.

---

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a **modular and scalable architecture**, ensuring robustness and extensibility.

### 2.1 Data Layer
- Customer, order, category, logistics, and process-related variables  
- Leakage-aware preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Explicit handling of class imbalance  

### 2.2 Modeling & Analytics Layer
- Supervised machine learning–based risk prediction  
- Risk score generation and categorical risk classification  
- Comparative evaluation across alternative algorithms  
- Emphasis on **generalizability over metric maximization**

### 2.3 Optimization Layer
- Probability threshold optimization aligned with operational costs  
- Iterative feedback loop for underperforming model paths  
- Decision-oriented risk calibration  

### 2.4 Presentation & Decision Layer
- Human-interpretable outputs:
  - Risk Score  
  - Risk Class  
  - Dominant Contributing Variables  
  - Operational Interpretation  
- Academic reporting and colloquium-ready visualization outputs

## 5. Methodological Approach

Model evaluation was conducted with a **methodology-first perspective**, where predictive performance is assessed alongside:

- F1-Score and class stability  
- Sensitivity to data leakage  
- Robustness across validation splits  
- Interpretability and decision relevance  

The project explicitly avoids **black-box optimization**, prioritizing **explainable and auditable modeling choices**.

---

## 6. Explainability and Decision Support

Each prediction generated by the system includes:

- Continuous **risk score**
- Discrete **risk class** (Low / Medium / High)
- Key contributing features
- Operationally meaningful interpretation

This design ensures that model outputs **support human decision-making rather than replace it**, aligning with real operational and managerial needs.

---

## 7. Results and Outcomes

The finalized system successfully delivers:

- A validated and leakage-aware ML pipeline  
- Interpretable, decision-ready risk outputs  
- Agile-compliant development documentation  
- Reproducible academic deliverables  
- Presentation-ready decision support artifacts

---

## 9. Conclusion

This repository demonstrates a **holistic approach to AI-driven risk management**, combining:

- Academic discipline  
- Engineering best practices  
- Agile methodology  
- Decision-oriented analytics  

It reflects not only **what was built**, but **how a serious, production-ready AI system should be designed and validated**.
